# TELA

The purpose of this final degree project is to develop an open source framework for social network analysis named “Tela”, which applications can communicate to via a REST API.

Tela aims to help developers to create applications that interact with one or more social networks, simplifying and unifying the authentication process and action execution. Some other helpful features offered by Tela are scheduling capabilities, request caching and data warehouse functionality.

Tela is designed to be highly extensible by the use of functionality modules that developers can implement. Furthermore, Tela already has two built-in modules: an Instagram one, which completely covers the read functionality of the Instagram API; and a Twitter module, with basic analysis functionality.

In addition to Tela, three more applications have been developed: “Tela CLI”, “Tela Who?” and “Tela Hawk”. These systems, which are based on Tela, offer different types of social network analysis for distinct target users; at the same time than they act as proof of concept for applications powered by Tela.

Developed by [Álvaro Reneses](http://www.reneses.io) as his Final Degree Project (Software Engineering) at [University of Oviedo](http://www.uniovi.es).
